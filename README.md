# Applying-ARIMA-model-in-Forecast-Exchange-Rate
ARIMA Model- R Code 
Goal: Apply ARIMA models to predict the exchange rate (USD/CNY). The steps of process are:
               + Model Indentification: Data plots, ACF, FACF, stationarity checks
               + Parameter Estimation: Least squares methods
               + Diagnostic Checking: Residual Analysis
               + Forcasting: Out-of-sample forecats.
